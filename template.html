      This will create a single page for your app    
      There should be at least one page in each HTML file of your app

      <!--
        This will create a main heading bar at the top of the app
        This may be left out if it isn't needed for your app

        <h1>Sample Heading</h1>

      <!--
        This will create a navigation bar for your app
        This may be left out if it isn't needed for your app
        Your navbar could also be placed before the header, in the header,
        and/or in the footer

              Make sure these classes are only used on the element representing
              the current page.  Example: When you make the second page the 
              classes would be on the element of the link for the second page
              and removed from this element.
              
              Refer to my projectile app example if you want to see this fully
              implemented on an app with two HTML files.

              The href in your app would need to be updated to the file that it
              links to.  In this version, it will just reload the page and show
              this as the active link when clicked since I don't have a second
              page right now in my app.

        This should be included in each page div

        <p>Sample text in the content</p>

      <!--
        This will create a bar at the bottom of the app after the content
        This may be left out if it isn't need for your app
